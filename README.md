# Presentation Info for Python Toronto July 2017

Join us for our first PyData Toronto Meetup on Wednesday, July 12 at 7 PM,
hosted by HackLab.TO

We are excited to host Stephen Childs who will be discussing data analysis in
Python with pandas.

Pandas (http://pandas.pydata.org) is a tool for working with tabular data in
Python. It allows you to import data from almost any source, clean, organize
and analyze it and save the data to almost any format.

Pandas works well with other packages for dealing with data in Python as well
as the built-in Python data structures.

In this hands-on session, we will have a quick tutorial on the basics of
using pandas for data analysis and then apply those skills to some real data.
Participants at all levels of skill with Python, pandas or data analysis will
get something out of the session.

The session will cover:

* Importing from and exporting to a variety of data formats and sources
* Data exploration
* Subsetting data
* Using the index in pandas
* Grouping and aggregating data
* Merging data
* Working with other packages (e.g. scikit-learn)

The easiest way to install pandas on your laptop is to install the Anaconda
distribution (https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Download the Python 3.6
version.

Please be on time and bring your laptop.
